# /ship — Ship It (Solo Workflow)

Review + test + gates + AC verify + task done + commit — all in one.
## When to Use

- User says "ship it", "done", "wrap up", "готово", "отправляй"
- Work is complete and user wants to close everything cleanly

## Algorithm

### 1. Find Active Task

Use `tausik_task_list` MCP tool with `status=active`.

If no active task — check git status for uncommitted changes and offer just commit.

### 2. Get Task Context

Use `tausik_task_show` with `slug={slug}` to load AC, plan steps, goal.

### 3. Verify Plan Completion

Check all plan steps are done. If not — warn which steps are incomplete. Ask: "Mark remaining steps done, or complete them first?"

### 4. Review Changes (full /review)

Run the full `/review` skill — NOT a lightweight check. Use the Agent tool to launch review in a subagent.

**Auto-escalate to deep mode** when the diff touches security-sensitive code (auth, payment, crypto, session handling, PII, secrets management) OR >5 files across multiple modules OR the task role is `security`/`architect`. In that case, append `deep` to the review scope so `/review` runs two sequential critic passes (see `agents/skills/review/SKILL.md` → "Adversarial Mode (built-in) → Deep mode").

**How to invoke:** Read `agents/skills/review/SKILL.md` yourself first, then pass the FULL contents as part of the Agent prompt (subagents cannot read files — they need instructions inline):

```
Agent(prompt: "[Paste full contents of review SKILL.md here]
Review scope: git diff (unstaged + staged changes) [append 'deep' if critical].
Task: {slug}, Goal: {goal}, AC: {AC}, Stack: {stack}.",
subagent_type: "general-purpose")
```

**If review verdict = FAIL (CRITICAL/HIGH issues):** Stop. Show issues. Do NOT proceed to commit. User must fix first.
**If review verdict = PASS or PASS WITH ISSUES (MEDIUM/LOW only):** Continue.

### 5. Run Tests (full /test)

Run the full `/test` skill — do NOT re-implement test logic here. Use the Agent tool to launch test in a subagent.

**How to invoke:** Read `agents/skills/test/SKILL.md` yourself first, then pass the FULL contents as part of the Agent prompt:

```
Agent(prompt: "[Paste full contents of test SKILL.md here]
Run tests for the current project. Stack: {stack}.",
subagent_type: "general-purpose")
```

Quality gates run automatically on `tausik_task_done` in step 7.

**If tests fail:** Stop. Show failures. Do NOT proceed. User must fix first.
**If tests pass:** Continue.

### 6. Verify Acceptance Criteria

Walk each AC from the task:
- State the criterion
- Verify it's met (check code, test output)
- Build evidence string

Log evidence: `tausik_task_log` with `slug={slug}`, `message="AC verified: 1. [criterion] ✓ [evidence] 2. [criterion] ✓ [evidence]"`

### 7. Commit (delegates to /commit)

Execute the `/commit` skill: read `agents/skills/commit/SKILL.md` and follow its full algorithm (stage → gates → message → confirm → commit → verify).

Reference task slug in the commit message body.

**If commit fails** (pre-commit hook, user declines): Stop. Do NOT close the task. Fix the issue and retry.

### 8. Close Task

**Only after successful commit.** Use `tausik_task_done` with `slug={slug}`, `ac_verified=true`, `relevant_files=[...]` (files from the commit).

### 9. Update Documentation (auto)

After commit, check if structural changes were made (new files, renamed modules, changed APIs):
- Run `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` to see changed files
- If files in `scripts/`, `agents/`, `bootstrap/`, or core modules changed — suggest updating `references/` documentation
- Update only files in `references/` that are directly affected (e.g., `architecture.md`, `project-cli.md`)
- Do NOT touch `CLAUDE.md`, `QWEN.md`, or `.cursorrules` — those are managed by bootstrap
- If no structural changes — skip silently

### 10. Push (optional)

After commit + task close, ask the user: **"Push to remote? (y/n)"**

If confirmed, follow the push procedure from `/commit` skill (step 8).

### 11. Summary

Show:
- Task completed: slug + title
- Gate results: pass/warn
- Commit hash
- Push status (pushed to origin/branch or skipped)
- Suggest: "Next task? Use `/task list` to pick one, or `/end` to wrap up the session."

## Edge Cases

- **AC verification fails**: Stop, report which AC failed, suggest what to fix
- **No tests exist**: Warn but don't block (suggest writing tests)
- **Multiple active tasks**: Compare `git diff --name-only` against each task's `scope` field (from `tausik_task_show`). If no scope set, ask the user which task to ship
- **Nothing to commit**: Skip commit step, just close task
- **Push gate blocks**: Use `TAUSIK_ALLOW_PUSH=1` env — this skill is authorized to push after user confirmation

## Gotchas

- **Do not ship without user confirmation for push.** The "Push to remote?" prompt is non-negotiable; CI auto-push is a separate story.
- **Gate failures stop the ship early.** If ruff/pytest fails, do NOT force-commit — fix the root cause first.
- **AC evidence format matters.** QG-2 parses notes for "✓" and test counts; commits without evidence in task_log will be blocked by the task_done gate.
- **Multiple active tasks create scope ambiguity.** If the diff spans two tasks' scope, ask the user which task this ship belongs to — do not guess.
- **Don't amend the ship commit after push.** Pushing then amending forces the user to force-push; create a follow-up commit instead.
