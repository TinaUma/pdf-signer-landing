# /checkpoint — Context Snapshot (SENAR-aligned)

Quick context save without ending the session.
**When to use:** After completing a task or step, before large operations, every 30-50 tool calls.

**vs /end:** No session end, no commit prompt. ~4 tool calls vs ~8.

## Algorithm

### 1. Gather state + check session duration

Run in parallel (prefer MCP tools, CLI as fallback):
- `tausik_session_current` MCP tool
- `tausik_task_list` MCP tool with status=active
- `tausik_status` MCP tool
- `tausik_memory_block` MCP tool — re-inject decisions/conventions/dead ends to refresh context before continuing
- `git branch --show-current`

**SENAR Rule 9.2:** If `status` shows a session duration warning — tell the user prominently:
> "Session has been running for X min (limit: Y min). Consider wrapping up with /end."

### 2. Save handoff

Build handoff JSON and save via `tausik_session_handoff` with `handoff={...}`:

```json
{
  "completed": ["task-slug-1: brief description"],
  "in_progress": [{"slug": "task-slug-2", "state": "step 3 of 5"}],
  "key_files": ["scripts/file1.py"],
  "dead_ends": [],
  "next_steps": ["Continue task-slug-2"],
  "warnings": ["Note for next checkpoint"]
}
```

### 3. Update CLAUDE.md

Use `tausik_update_claudemd` MCP tool to refresh the dynamic section.

### 4. Confirm

Tell the user: "Checkpoint saved. Context preserved for session continuity."
If session duration warning was shown, reiterate it.

**Suggest next:** "Continue with current task, or `/end` to wrap up the session."

**That's it.** No session close, no commit prompt, no memory saves. Keep it fast.

## Gotchas

- **Handoff JSON must be valid JSON** — unescaped quotes in values will break the command.
- **Checkpoint does NOT commit** — code changes are only in working tree.
- **Session duration** — if over limit, warn at every checkpoint. This is the agent's obligation (SENAR Rule 9.2).
